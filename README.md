🧠 StudyBuddy – My First AI Product Case Study

Hi! I’m Shifa, an aspiring AI Product Manager. StudyBuddy is my very first hands-on project where I applied what I’ve been learning about user-centered product design and AI thinking.

This case study is more than a portfolio piece — it’s something I built to solve a real problem many students face: staying consistent while studying. If you’ve ever struggled with motivation, burnout, or planning, this one’s for you.


🚨 The Problem

From talking to students around me and reflecting on my own experience, I noticed a pattern:
	•	They get excited in the beginning,   but lose motivation quickly
	•	They don’t know how to structure      their time
	•	They feel overwhelmed by too many     resources
	•	They often study alone, which         makes it harder to stay consistent

💡 The Idea

So I asked myself: What if students had a smart study buddy that helped them plan, motivated them daily, and kept them on track without feeling robotic?

That’s how StudyBuddy was born a friendly AI companion designed to help students:
	•	📅 Organize their study week with     smart schedules
	•	🔔 Get small nudges and check-ins     to stay consistent
	•	💬 Ask questions and get instant    AI-powered help
	•	📊 Track progress and celebrate      small wins
 
👥 Talking to Users
I interviewed a few students and        noticed two clear user types:
•	Riya (19) – “I know what I want,       but I can’t stick to a schedule.”
	•	Ayaan (21) – “ChatGPT is cool, but    I wish it felt more like a coach.”

Some interesting insights:
	•	✨ 4 out of 5 students feel           overwhelmed by study pressure
	•	✨ 75% said they’d love a            supportive, AI-powered assistant

 🧠 Core Features

Based on those insights, I focused the MVP on:
	•	A GPT-4-based learning companion
	•	Personalized planning inside Notion
	•	Mood check-ins and daily nudges
	•	Streaks, progress bars, and            motivational feedback
	•	Instant support for micro-questions

🎯 MVP Goals

✅ What I built:

A Notion-integrated AI planner (concept prototype) that helps students:
	•	Plan their week
	•	Reflect on how they’re feeling
	•	Track progress and get daily           reminders
